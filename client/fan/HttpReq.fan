  ** should be made using credentials such as cookies, authorization
  ** headers or TLS client certificates. Setting 'withCredentials' has
  ** no effect on same-site requests. The default is 'false'.
  **
  ** Requests from a different domain cannot set cookie values  for
  ** their own domain unless 'withCredentials' is set to 'true' before
  ** making the request. The third-party cookies obtained by setting
  ** 'withCredentials' to 'true' will still honor same-origin policy and

  ** downloaded to the browser.  For 'PUT' and 'POST' requests, the
  ** progress will track the content being uploaded to the server.

  ** Note this callback is only invoked when 'lengthComputable' is
  ** 'true' on the underlying progress events.
